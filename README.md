This project was conducted as a test to get an internship in a web developing startup using mainly ReactJS.<br>

The test lasted seven days, where I had to learn the basics of React and deliver something by the seventh day.<br>
Here is a [link](https://github.com/zandoan/turing-frontend) to the github page stating the challenge.<br>

To run the project, please follow these simple steps :<br>
## installation of 'node' and package manager 'yarn'
If you do not have 'node' package installed on your system, please install it ([link to nodejs's website](https://nodejs.org/en/))<br>

After the installation of 'node', install the package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)<br>

## 'yarn start' or 'npm start'
Depending on the package manager you have installed, type in<br>

### 'yarn install'<br>

on your line command in the root of the cloned turing-app repository to install the node_modules needed.<br>

Finally, type in<br>

### 'yarn start'

to run the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
